# SDA-1-Global-Suicide-Insights-Dashboard

## About the Dataset
The dataset provides global suicide statistics from 1987 to 2014, capturing demographic, geographical, and economic details. Key variables include age, gender, GDP, population, and suicide counts, offering a comprehensive view of societal and economic influences on mental health. The data's purpose is to analyze suicide trends and identify potential factors for preventive action.

The dataset utilized in this project was obtained from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/code/kralmachine/data-visualization-of-suicide-rates


## Objective of the Dashboard
The objectives of this analysis are to identify trends in suicide rates over time, both globally and regionally, to discern patterns of increase or decrease. It aims to provide demographic insights by investigating the influence of age, gender, and generational classifications on suicide rates. The study will examine the economic impact by analyzing the relationship between economic indicators such as GDP per capita, GDP, and HDI with suicide rates. A cross-country analysis will be conducted to compare suicide rates across nations and regions, identifying high-risk areas. Additionally, the generational impact will be explored to understand how different generations are affected and whether these trends vary across countries. The analysis will also focus on identifying significant correlations between HDI, economic factors, and suicide rates to uncover predictors. Ultimately, the findings will inform data-driven recommendations for governments and policymakers to address and mitigate suicide trends effectively.

### Chart 9  Age-wise Suicide Numbers by Gender"
This is a line chart showing the number of suicides by age group and gender. The chart shows that males have a higher suicide rate than females in all age groups. The suicide rate is highest for males in the 35-54 year age group and decreases with age. The suicide rate for females is lowest in the 5-14 year age group and increases with age, with the highest rate in the 55-74 year age group.

#### Description of the chart:
•	The chart shows the total number of suicides for each age group, broken down by gender.
•	The x-axis represents the age group.
•	The y-axis represents the number of suicides.
•	The lines on the chart represent the number of suicides for each gender.

#### Interpretation of the chart:
•	The chart shows that the suicide rate for males is higher than the suicide rate for females in all age groups.
•	The chart also shows that the suicide rate for both genders generally decreases with age, although there are some exceptions.

#### Insights gained from the chart:
•	This chart suggests that men are more likely to commit suicide than women across all age groups. This is a well-documented finding, and there are a number of potential explanations for this difference. For example, men are often socialized to be more stoic and to hide their emotions, which may make it more difficult for them to seek help when they are struggling. Men are also more likely to work in high-stress jobs, which can increase their risk of suicide.
•	The chart also suggests that the suicide rate is generally higher for people in their 30s and 40s, then decreases with age. This finding could be related to the fact that this is often a time of great change and stress in people’s lives, as they are navigating career and family responsibilities.

#### Potential reasons for the insights:
•	Socialization and gender roles: Men are often socialized to be more stoic and to hide their emotions, which may make it more difficult for them to seek help when they are struggling. This can lead to men feeling more isolated and hopeless, which increases their risk of suicide.
•	Work and employment: Men are more likely to work in high-stress jobs, which can increase their risk of suicide. They are also more likely to be unemployed, which can lead to feelings of failure and worthlessness.

### Chart 10 Suicide Trends in Russia, the US and China
The line chart shows the yearly suicide trends in Russia (green line), the US (red and blue lines), and China (pink line) from 1987 to 2014.

#### Interpretation of the chart:
•	Russia: Russia has the highest suicide rate among the three countries, peaking around 1994-1995. There's a significant decline in suicide rates from 1996 onwards, although the rate remains relatively high compared to other countries.
•	US: The US suicide rates follow a somewhat different trend. The red line (which could be either the US or the US) shows a slight upward trend from 1987 to 2014. The blue line (which could be either the US or the US), on the other hand, shows a fluctuating trend, with higher rates in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
•	China: China experiences the lowest suicide rates compared to Russia and the US. The rate shows a steady upward trend from 1987 to 2004, followed by a decline until 2012 and a slight increase towards 2014.

#### Insights:
•	Russia: Russia's high suicide rate in the early 1990s could be attributed to the socio-economic and political turmoil following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The subsequent decline suggests possible improvements in social support systems and economic conditions.
•	US: The US suicide trends are more complex and require further investigation. The discrepancy between the two lines (red and blue) representing the US, might indicate variations in specific demographics or data collection methods.
•	China: China's suicide rate trends could reflect a combination of factors, including changes in economic conditions, urbanization, and social support systems. The rise in suicides until 2004 might be associated with the rapid economic growth and social changes of that period, while the decline after 2004 could suggest some improvement in coping mechanisms and mental health awareness.

#### Potential reasons for insights:
•	Economic conditions: Economic downturns, unemployment, and income inequality are often linked to higher suicide rates.
•	Social support systems: Strong social support networks and access to mental health services can play a significant role

### Chart 11 Average Suicide Rate by Age Group and Gender
The bar chart compares the average suicide rate of males and females across different age groups. The blue bars represent males, and the red bars represent females. The height of the bars indicates the average number of suicides per 100,000 people.

#### Interpretation:
The chart reveals a significant difference in suicide rates between males and females across all age groups, with men consistently exhibiting higher rates than women. The largest disparity is observed in the 35-54 age group, where the male suicide rate is considerably higher than the female rate.

#### Insights:
Males are at a significantly higher risk of suicide than females across all age groups, highlighting a gender disparity in suicidal behavior.
Potential Reasons: Numerous factors contribute to the higher suicide rates among men, including:
•	Societal pressures: Men often face societal pressures to suppress emotions and maintain a strong facade, leading to feelings of isolation and lack of support.
•	Higher risk-taking behaviors: Men are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, including alcohol abuse, substance use, and dangerous activities, which can contribute to suicide risk.
•	Unequal access to mental health services: Men are less likely to seek mental health help due to societal stigma, leading to untreated mental health conditions that can increase suicide risk.

#### Chart 12 Total Suicides by Country and Age Group
This chart shows the total number of suicides per country for different age groups. The height of each bar represents the total number of suicides in that country for that age group. The color of each bar represents the age group.

The chart shows that the United States has the highest number of suicides for all age groups, followed by Japan. The chart also shows that the number of suicides increases with age, with the highest number of suicides occurring in the 75+ year old age group.

The chart shows that the US and Japan have a high number of suicides across all age groups. This suggests that there are some underlying factors in these countries that contribute to suicide risk. The higher suicide rates in older age groups could be related to factors such as chronic illness, social isolation, and financial stress.

#### Possible reasons for the insights:
•	US: High rates of gun ownership, mental health stigma, and economic inequality.
•	Japan: High social pressure, workaholism, and a culture of shame.

#### Insights gained:
•	The US and Japan have the highest number of suicides across all age groups.
•	The number of suicides increases with age.
•	There are some underlying factors in these countries that contribute to suicide risk.
•	Older people are more susceptible to suicide due to factors such as chronic illness, social isolation, and financial stress.

### Chart 13 Analysis of Suicide Rates by Country
The provided image is a world map depicting suicide rates per 100k population. It uses a color scale to indicate the severity of suicide rates, with darker shades representing higher rates.
Region-Wise Analysis
Region: Europe
The map shows a significant cluster of countries with high suicide rates in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and surrounding areas. The darker blue shades in this region indicate a higher number of suicides per 100k population compared to other regions.

#### Interpretation:
This suggests a higher prevalence of suicide in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia.
#### Insights:
The potential reasons for this trend could be complex and multi-faceted, including:
•	Economic hardship: Post-Soviet transition economies in Eastern Europe have experienced economic hardship, which could contribute to increased stress and despair.
•	Cultural factors: Some cultures may have varying levels of stigma associated with mental health, potentially discouraging individuals from seeking help.
•	Alcohol consumption: Higher rates of alcohol consumption in Eastern Europe could contribute to suicide risk.
•	Historical events: Trauma from historical events, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, could have lingering impacts on mental health.
Region: North America
•	Description: The map shows relatively lower suicide rates in North America, with the exception of a few areas in the northern United States and Canada.
•	Interpretation: This suggests that suicide rates are generally lower in North America compared to Eastern Europe.
•	Insights: While the rates are relatively lower, it's important to acknowledge the impact of mental health on individuals and communities. Factors such as:
•	Access to healthcare: The availability of mental health services and resources could play a role in suicide prevention.
•	Social support systems: Stronger social support networks and community involvement can provide a sense of belonging and offer coping mechanisms.
•	Economic stability: Economic stability can contribute to feelings of security and well-being.

### Chart 13 Correlation Between GDP and Suicide Rate
The scatter plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and suicide rate per 100k population for 101 countries. Each point represents a country, and the color of the point represents the country. The x-axis represents GDP per capita, and the y-axis represents the suicide rate per 100k population.

#### Interpretation of charts:
The chart shows a weak negative correlation between GDP per capita and suicide rate. This means that, in general, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have lower suicide rates. However, there is a lot of variation within the data, and there are many countries with high GDP per capita that also have high suicide rates.
#### Insights gained:
•	There is no clear-cut relationship between GDP per capita and suicide rate. Other factors like mental health services, social support networks, and cultural norms likely play a more significant role.
•	Even wealthy countries with high GDP can face challenges in terms of mental health and suicide rates.
•	This suggests that economic development alone is not sufficient to address suicide prevention.
•	Focus on addressing the underlying factors like mental health infrastructure, stigma, and social support systems is essential.

#### Potential reasons for the insights:
•	Mental Health Infrastructure: Countries with better mental health infrastructure, including access to mental health professionals and resources, might experience lower suicide rates regardless of their wealth.
•	Social Support Networks: Strong social support networks and community cohesion could provide a buffer against mental health issues and suicide risk.
•	Cultural Norms: Societal attitudes and cultural norms towards mental health and suicide can significantly impact suicide rates.
•	Other Factors: Other factors such as unemployment, inequality, and access to firearms can also influence suicide rates.

### Insights:
#### Age and Suicide: 
The highest proportion of suicide cases occur in the 35-54 age group, followed by the 55-74 age group. Younger demographics have a lower suicide rate. This suggests that middle-aged and older populations may experience unique stressors related to career, family responsibilities, financial pressures, and health issues.

#### Generational Trends:
The Boomers and Silent Generation have a higher suicide rate compared to younger generations. This likely reflects the historical events and socioeconomic pressures they faced. Younger generations, while facing different challenges, benefit from increased mental health awareness and resources.

#### Gender Differences:
Males have a significantly higher suicide rate than females across all age groups. This disparity highlights the need for a targeted approach to suicide prevention, addressing gender-specific issues and promoting a culture of emotional expression for men.

#### Time Trends:
Suicide rates fluctuate over time, with periods of increase linked to economic crises and social changes. While younger generations are experiencing higher rates in recent years, the impact of technology, social media, and isolation requires further investigation.

#### Global Variation:
Suicide rates vary significantly across countries, with Eastern Europe having the highest rates. This suggests that societal factors, economic conditions, cultural norms, and access to mental health resources all play a role.

#### GDP and Suicide: 
While a weak negative correlation exists between GDP per capita and suicide rate, the relationship is not straightforward. High GDP does not guarantee low suicide rates, and focusing solely on economic development is insufficient for suicide prevention.

## Managerial Implications

#### Targeted Policies for High-Risk Demographics:
Insights from gender and age-group distributions can guide mental health programs tailored to vulnerable populations, such as older males.

#### Regional Prioritization:
Countries with high suicide rates (e.g., Russia) should receive focused attention with targeted initiatives like helplines, awareness campaigns, and funding for mental health services.

#### Economic Interventions:
The correlation between GDP and suicide rates suggests that improving economic conditions, reducing inequality, and creating employment opportunities can alleviate suicide rates.

#### Generational Approaches:
Analysis of generational trends highlights the importance of addressing specific generational challenges, such as job stability for Millennials or retirement support for Boomers.

#### Data-Driven Mental Health Campaigns:
Temporal trends and spikes can help governments and NGOs design proactive campaigns around high-risk periods, such as economic recessions or holidays.

#### Global Collaborations:
Countries with similar trends can collaborate to share best practices and research findings to combat mental health challenges.
