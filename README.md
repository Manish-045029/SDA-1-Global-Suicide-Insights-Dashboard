## Managerial Implications

### Targeted Policies for High-Risk Demographics:
Insights from gender and age-group distributions can guide mental health programs tailored to vulnerable populations, such as older males.

### Regional Prioritization:
Countries with high suicide rates (e.g., Russia) should receive focused attention with targeted initiatives like helplines, awareness campaigns, and funding for mental health services.

### Economic Interventions:
The correlation between GDP and suicide rates suggests that improving economic conditions, reducing inequality, and creating employment opportunities can alleviate suicide rates.

### Generational Approaches:
Analysis of generational trends highlights the importance of addressing specific generational challenges, such as job stability for Millennials or retirement support for Boomers.

### Data-Driven Mental Health Campaigns:
Temporal trends and spikes can help governments and NGOs design proactive campaigns around high-risk periods, such as economic recessions or holidays.

### Global Collaborations:
Countries with similar trends can collaborate to share best practices and research findings to combat mental health challenges.
